# Cross-Listed Course and Removed Course Conflict Detection Fix

## Problems Fixed

### 1. Cross-Listed Course Issue
The original conflict detection logic completely skipped ALL conflict checking for cross-listed courses:

```go
crosslist, err := scheduler.AreCoursesCrosslisted(course1.CRN, course2.CRN)
if err != nil || crosslist {
    // Skip crosslisted courses
    continue  // ❌ This skipped ALL conflict detection!
}
```

This meant that cross-listed courses could not have ANY conflicts detected, which is incorrect.

### 2. Removed Course Issue
Courses with "Removed" status were still being included in conflict detection, which is incorrect since removed courses shouldn't conflict with any other courses.

## Solutions

### 1. Cross-Listed Course Fix
Updated the logic to allow cross-listed courses to be exempt from **specific types** of conflicts while still detecting others:

#### ✅ What Cross-Listed Courses Can Share (No Conflict)
- **Same Instructor**: Cross-listed courses represent the same class offered under different numbers
- **Same Room**: They are essentially the same class, so sharing a room is expected
- **Same Time**: They should meet at the same time since they're the same class

#### ❌ What Cross-Listed Courses Still Conflict On
- **Different Instructors**: Cross-listed courses should have the same instructor
- **Different Rooms**: Cross-listed courses should meet in the same location  
- **Different Times**: Cross-listed courses should meet at the same time

### 2. Removed Course Fix
Added status checking to exclude courses with "Removed" status from ALL conflict detection:

#### ✅ Removed Course Behavior
- **No Conflicts**: Courses with "Removed" status cannot conflict with any other course
- **Complete Exclusion**: Removed courses are skipped in all conflict detection types:
  - Instructor conflicts
  - Room conflicts  
  - Cross-listing conflicts
  - Course-level conflicts

## Code Changes

### 1. Updated Main Conflict Detection Logic (`controllers.go`)

**Before (Cross-listing issue):**
```go
if err != nil || crosslist {
    continue  // Skip ALL checking
}
```

**After (Both fixes):**
```go
// Skip courses with "Removed" status - they cannot conflict with any other course
if course1.Status == "Removed" || course2.Status == "Removed" {
    continue
}

// Check for instructor conflicts
if course1.InstructorID == course2.InstructorID && course1.InstructorID > 0 {
    // Cross-listed courses CAN share the same instructor without conflict
    if !crosslist {
        // Only flag as conflict for non-crosslisted courses
        // ... add to instructor conflicts
    }
}

// Check for room conflicts  
if course1.RoomID == course2.RoomID && ... && !crosslist {
    // Only flag as conflict for non-crosslisted courses
    // ... add to room conflicts
}
```

### 2. Updated CourseDetail Structure
Added Status field to CourseDetail struct and populated it in getCoursesWithDetails function.

### 3. Updated Cross-listing Conflict Detection
Added status checking in `detectCrosslistingConflicts()` function.

### 4. Updated Course Conflict Detection  
Added status checking in `detectCourseConflicts()` function.

### 2. Existing Cross-Listing Conflict Detection
The `detectCrosslistingConflicts()` function already properly handles detecting when cross-listed courses have **mismatched** properties (different instructors, rooms, or times), which ARE actual conflicts.

### 3. Course-Level Conflicts
The `detectCourseConflicts()` function already properly uses `isCourseConflictException()` to exempt cross-listed courses from course number range conflicts.

## Testing

### Test Script 1: `sql/test_crosslisting_conflicts.sql`
Creates test scenarios to validate cross-listing fix:

1. **Cross-listed courses** (CS 2150 ↔ MATH 2150)
   - Same instructor, room, time
   - Should NOT show instructor/room conflicts

2. **Regular courses** (CS 1120, CS 1150)  
   - Same instructor, room, time
   - SHOULD show instructor/room conflicts

### Test Script 2: `sql/test_removed_course_conflicts.sql`
Creates test scenarios to validate removed course fix:

1. **Active courses** (Status: "Scheduled")
   - Same instructor, room, time
   - SHOULD conflict with each other

2. **Removed course** (Status: "Removed")
   - Same instructor, room, time as active courses
   - Should NOT conflict with any other course

3. **Deleted course** (Status: "Deleted")  
   - Same instructor, room, time as active courses
   - Should NOT conflict with any other course

### Validation Steps
1. Run both test SQL scripts to create test data
2. Use the conflict detection tool in the scheduler
3. Verify cross-listed courses don't generate false conflicts
4. Verify removed/deleted courses don't generate any conflicts
5. Verify regular active courses still generate appropriate conflicts

## Impact
- ✅ **Fixed**: Cross-listed courses no longer generate false positive conflicts
- ✅ **Fixed**: Removed courses are completely excluded from conflict detection
- ✅ **Maintained**: All other conflict detection logic remains intact
- ✅ **Enhanced**: Better error handling for cross-listing checks
- ✅ **Enhanced**: Status-aware conflict detection
- ✅ **Documented**: Clear comments explain the cross-listing and status logic

## Files Modified
- `src/controllers.go`: Updated main conflict detection logic, CourseDetail struct, and all conflict detection functions
- `sql/test_crosslisting_conflicts.sql`: Added test validation script for cross-listing
- `sql/test_removed_course_conflicts.sql`: Added test validation script for removed courses
- `CROSSLISTING_CONFLICT_FIX.md`: This documentation

The fixes ensure that:
1. Cross-listed courses (which represent the same class under different course numbers) can appropriately share resources without triggering false conflict alerts, while still detecting legitimate conflicts when cross-listed courses have mismatched properties.
2. Courses with "Removed" status are completely excluded from all conflict detection since they represent courses that are no longer active in the schedule.
